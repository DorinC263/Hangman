# How to Play

Follow these simple steps to play the Hangman game:

1. Run the Hangman.exe executable or build and run the C# project.
2. The game will randomly select a word, and the hangman progress will be displayed as underscores representing each letter of the word.
3. Guess letters one at a time by entering them on the command line or in the game interface.
4. You have a limited number of attempts (lives) before the hangman is complete. The number of attempts is usually displayed to the player.
5. If you guess a letter that exists in the word, it will be revealed in its corresponding position(s) on the display.
6. If you guess a letter that does not exist in the word, you will lose one attempt (life), and part of the hangman will be drawn.
7. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the entire word correctly or run out of attempts.
8. If you guess the word within the attempts, you win! Congratulations!
9. If you use up all your attempts before guessing the word correctly, the hangman will be complete, and you lose the game.

Enjoy playing Hangman in C# and have fun guessing words!
